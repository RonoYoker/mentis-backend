    "pretext": """Thank you for taking the time to complete this questionnaire. It is designed to help detect potential symptoms of anxiety and depression. Here are some important things to keep in mind:
No Right or Wrong Answers: This is not a test you can pass or fail. It’s simply a way to better understand your mental health.
Consider Your Entire Week: Try to think about your overall mood and feelings throughout the last 2 weeks, not just today or how you’re feeling right now.
Estimated Time: The questionnaire takes about 5–10 minutes to complete.
Use the Rating Scale: Each question asks how frequently you have experienced certain thoughts or feelings. Use the scale provided to choose the answer that best matches your experience:
Not at all
Somedays
More than half the days
Nearly every day
This Is Not a Diagnosis: Results are for guidance only; consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation.""",
